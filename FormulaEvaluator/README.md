# Comments to Evaluators:

My work stands on its own

# Assignment Specific Topics
1. I estimated that it would take me about 10 hours to complete this assignment.
2. All together, I spend about 8 hours on the code. For the most part, 5 hours were actually
spent trying to make forward progress. I spent an hour and a half trying to get my repository working correctly as well
as figuring out small things that I couldn't remember. The last hour and a half was debugging. I was able to notice the
mistakes quicker than normal which helped a lot.

# Consulted Peers:
