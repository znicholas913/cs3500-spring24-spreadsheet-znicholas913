# Comments to Evaluators:

My works stands on it's own.

# Assignment Specific Topics
1. I think this assignment will take about 8 hours to complete because it is mostly connecting the previous assignments
together.
2. All together it took me 10 hours. I did not think about fixing my previous code when I was making my estimate. I probably 
spent about 4 hours creating new code, 2 hours fixing my previous code, another 2 hours trying to debug and fix the 
code I was working on, and another 2 trying to fix all my files which is still being a massive problem for me.
