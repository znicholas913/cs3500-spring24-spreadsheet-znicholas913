# Comments to Evaluators:

My works stands on it's own.

# Assignment Specific Topics
1. I think this assignment will take about 13 hours to complete because it is mostly adding to the previous spreadsheet class.
However, it still will require a lot of work that I don't know much about.
2. All together it took me 14 hours. I'm really have a hard time understanding how xml works. I can write it well to a 
file and string, but I still don't understand reading the file well. So this was a big learning curve and the learning itself
took about 5 hours total. Then working on the code took me about 7 hours to complete. The last 2 hours was spend on other things
like the whiteboard and other small tasks involved.
3. In terms of time management I have learned that I am terrible at it. I have way too much going on in my life right now
and it's been taking a huge toll on me. My estimation is getting better, but I think I need to learn how to plan ahead better.

# Examples of Good Software Practice
1. One good example is when I used the getXML string to write the file for save. This saved a lot of time and space. I was
able to just call the getXML method directly in the save method and it worked.
2. Another good one is that I used a recursive method to get all of the direct dependents for a given cell. This also helps to keep the 
code clean because all of it is not just piled up into one big mess and it allowed the main method to help that piece be correct.
3. The other good one is CheckCellName because I use this method in multiple places to check if a cell name is valid. If it 
weren't for this method, I would have so much repeating code.
