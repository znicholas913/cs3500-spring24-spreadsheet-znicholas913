# Comments to Evaluators:

My works stands on it's own.

# Assignment Specific Topics
1.I would say that it is not a good idea to have multiple classes or structs in a single file.
In some cases it can be a good thing and it can be more readable. However I feel like it wasn't very
necessary to have them all in one file for this assignment.
2. An immutable formula means it cannot be changed. It will return the same results all the time. It 
can't be changed. It would have to be replaced. 
3. In order to make them immutable, the properties and fields should be read only.
4. My formula is being stored in a string array. In order to check their equality I am comparing their ToString values.
