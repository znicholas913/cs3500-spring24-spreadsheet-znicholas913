# Comments to Evaluators:

I am on mac, so I have been using rider. Therefore some of the tests are a little bit
different regarding the [test] headers.

# Assignment Specific Topics
1. I estimated that it would take me about 9 hours to complete this assignment.
2. All together, I spend about 12 hours on the assignment. For the most part, 5 hours were actually
   spent working on the code. I spend at least 2 hours trying to figure out why my gitignore isn't working
and I still haven't figured that out yet. I spend 3 hours testing because I was having so many issues trying to 
get it to work. I spent about 2 hours debugging and trying to figure out where these little bugs were.

# Consulted Peers:

I worked on my own.
